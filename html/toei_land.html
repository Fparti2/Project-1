<p>Traveling to the Digital World was an experience that leaves the children bewildered. Their Digimon partners are suddenly thrust upon them, as well as the concept of having the Digimon digivolve into stronger creatures, and so the children have to find out how to be DigiDestined as they go along. They quickly learn of the Digital World's plight, and how evil Digimon are intent on ruling it for themselves. Although they originally fight just to return home, they eventually vow to save the Digital World for the sake of their Digimon friends.

  <p>A new generation of DigiDestined, composed of three new children, as well as Kari and T.K., are given a new kind of Digivice known as "D-3", which allows them to open a gate to be transported to the Digital World through any computer. Another advantage was Armor Digivolution, using a device called a Digi-Egg, so their Digimon can evolve in the presence of Control Spires. They eventually stop the Digimon Emperor, Ken Ichijouji, thanks to the sacrifice of Wormmon, Ken's partner.

  <p>Takato Matsuki creates his Digimon partner Guilmon when he slips a mysterious blue card he found in his deck through his hand-held card reading device, changing it into a D-Arc that scans his OC Digimon to create his new friend. Guilmon bio-emerges from the Digital World and is found later by Takato. Henry Wong met his Digimon Terriermon when he rose from the screen of a computer game, while Rika Nonaka's Digimon Renamon approached her to ask to be made stronger, since Rika was famous for her skills on the Digimon card game. Kazu Shioda, Kenta Kitagawa and Jeri Katou, Takato's friends from school, and Suzie Wong, Henry's little sister, become Tamers later on in the adventure, and the team eventually runs into Ryo Akiyama, Rika's rival and fellow Digimon Tamer. The children also have repeated encounters with Calumon, a mysterious Digimon that has the power to make other Digimon digivolve but dislikes fighting and only wants to play and eat junk food, and Impmon, a Digimon that left his Tamers Ai and Mako because he felt neglected, and has come to hate Digimon who work with humans.

    <p>The goal of the DigiDestined is to save the world, and to achieve that goal, they are granted the power to "Spirit Evolve" into the Legendary Warriors. For this special kind of evolution, they use Spirits, artifacts created by the Ten Legendary Warriors that were hidden in certain areas of the Digital World. When the characters first arrive in the Digital World, their cell phones turn into digivices called D-Tectors. Each character actually acquires two Spirits each, the "Human Spirits" and the stronger "Beast Spirits", each with varying strengths and weaknesses. The DigiDestined mainly travel the world via railroads, where train Digimon called "Trailmon" act as a means of transport.
